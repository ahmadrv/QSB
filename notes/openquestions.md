# **Open Questions**

- [ ] What is the reason of the spike in the results?
- [ ] All quantum calculations can be done by matrix multiplication. So they can be simulated with linear algebra tools. So what is the use of quantum simulators?
- [ ] Is there any approach to broadcast the implementation of each quantum algorithm in all platforms?
